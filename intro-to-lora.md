# Building your own LoRa network

There is a lot of buzz around [LoRa](https://www.lora-alliance.org), a wide-area network solution that promises kilometers of range with very low power consumption; a perfect fit for the Internet of Things. A number of telco's are currently rolling out networks, but because LoRa operates in the [open spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band) you don't need to wait for them. In this article we'll go over all the pieces required to build a private LoRa network, and how to use the network to send data from an ARM mbed end-node to the cloud.

## Requirements

A typical LoRa network consists of four parts.

![Topology of a LoRa network](assets/lora1.png)

On the hardware side we need devices and gateways, similar to how you set up a WiFi network. There is no gateway pinning here, all gateways within range of a device will receive the signal. Gateways are very simple, they just scan the spectrum and capture LoRa packets. The gateways then forward their data to a network service which handles the actual packet. It de-duplicates data when multiple gateways receive the same packet, it decrypts the message (everything is end-to-end encrypted), handles LoRa features like adaptive data rating, etc. Thereafter it forwards the decrypted data to your application.

### Device

On to the hardware. First we'll need to build a device. If you want to use ARM mbed (and you should) there are two options.

* Get the [Multitech mDot](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/MTS-mDot-F411/), and the [EVK board](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/multi-tech-systems-inc/MTUDK2-ST-MDOT/591-1278-ND/5247463).
* Get the [SX1276MB1xAS](https://developer.mbed.org/components/SX1276MB1xAS/) shield, and a microcontroller which runs mbed (in this article I'm using the [nrf51-DK](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/Nordic-nRF51-DK/), although most microcontrollers will work).

**Note:** When ordering hardware, always make sure that you get the variant which works in your region (f.e. 868 MHz in Europe, 915 MHz in the US).

### Gateways

We'll also need gateways. For development purposes one will be enough, but in a production deployment you'll always want at least two, as there will always be dark spots in your network. There's quite some [choice in gateways](https://www.loriot.io/gateways.html) we can use, but I've had good experience with these three:

* [Kerlink IoT station](http://www.kerlink.fr/en/products/lora-iot-station-2/lora-iot-station-868-mhz). Expensive (around 1200 euros), but great build quality and range.
* [Multitech Conduit](http://www.multitech.com/brands/multiconnect-conduit). About half the price of the Kerlink (around 550 euros), and pretty great for small setups (put a bigger antenna on it though).
* Building your own with a Raspberry Pi and an [IMST iC880A](http://www.wireless-solutions.de/products/long-range-radio/ic880a) concentrator. Most cost-efficient option (under 300 euros).

![Self built gateway using a Raspberry Pi and an IMST iC880A](assets/lora5.jpg)

*Self built LoRa gateway based on Raspberry Pi 2 and iC880A. Total cost ~300 euroâ€™s.*

### Network Server

Now on to the software side. We'll need a server which understands the LoRa protocol and can interpret the data being sent from the device. It's possible to roll your own (Semtech can give you their reference implementation if you sign an NDA), but there have also been companies building LoRa Network Servers as a service, handling everything on your behalf. Today we'll be using such a service, from the Switzerland-based startup [LORIOT](https://loriot.io).

LORIOT is free for up to one gateway, and up to ten end-devices, which is good enough for evaluation purposes. Unfortunately the free plan has some limitations: bi-directional data (sending messages back from the cloud to a device) is not included in the free plan, and over-the-air activation cannot be used, but upgrading is relatively cheap (starting at XX euros per month).

As a network server just processes your data, and thus not stores it, you'll need a place to store your messages as well. LORIOT allows you to hook in to their service over a socket (TCP or websocket) and forward your data to a cloud service (or straight to your application) of your choice.

## Setting up the gateway

We now need to configure our gateway by installing some software that will scan the spectrum and forward all LoRa packets to LORIOT. To do this we'll need to log into the gateway.

#### Kerlink IoT station

To configure the Kerlink, first connect the gateway over ethernet to your network. The gateway will now get an IP through DHCP. To quickly find the gateway you can look in the DHCP table on your router, or use [nmap](http://nmap.org) via `nmap -p 22 192.168.2.*` (if that's your subnet). You can now log into the gateway through ssh, with username `root` and password `root`.

@todo: how to stop the packet forwarder...

#### Multitech Conduit

The Conduit is unfortunately configured with DHCP disabled, so we need to enable this first. There are two options:

1. Connect to the Conduit over ethernet (from the Conduit to your computer), set a static IP address of 192.168.2.2 for your computer, and 192.168.2.1 as your router. Now log in through ssh to 192.168.2.1, with username `root` and password `root`.
1. Connect to the Conduit using a micro-USB cable, after which the gateway will list as a serial device. You can use a program like [GNU screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) or [PuTTY](http://putty.org) to log into the gateway.

Now enable DHCP by following Step 4 in [this document](http://www.multitech.net/developer/software/mlinux/getting-started-with-conduit-mlinux/). Afterwards connect the gateway over ethernet to your network, and follow the steps under 'Kerlink IoT station' to find the IP address and log in over SSH.

#### Raspberry Pi + IMST iC880A

First make sure that the Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet, and that you connected the IMST iC880A over USB (if you have the SPI version, take a look at the [IMST website](http://www.wireless-solutions.de/products/radiomodules/ic880a)). Log into the Pi over SSH, and follow Steps 3.1 - 3.5 in [this document](http://www.wireless-solutions.de/images/stories/downloads/Radio%20Modules/iC880A/iC880A_QuickStartGuide.pdf).

**Note:** Use [lora_gateway 2.0.0](https://github.com/Lora-net/lora_gateway/releases/tag/v2.0.0), not the latest version (run `git checkout v2.0.0` in the lora_gateway folder).

After following the steps restart the pi, and run:

```bash
~/LoRa/lora_gateway/lora_gateway/util_pkt_logger/util_pkt_logger
```

You should see 'INFO: concentrator started, packet can now be received', which indicates that everything is functioning.

### Installing the LORIOT software

Now that we have set up the gateways and they can reach the internet, it's time to install the LORIOT software on them, so they have a place to send the LoRa packets. First [sign up](https://eu1.loriot.io/register.html) for an account, after which you'll be redirected to the dashboard page. Click the link to register a new gateway.

![First step to registering a new gateway](assets/lora2.png)

You'll now be taken through a wizard. Just pick the gateway you have and follow the steps. Afterwards you'll be taken to the gateway page where you'll find the LORIOT binary for your platform, and a link to set up documentation.

![Almost there...](assets/lora3.png)

**Tip:** Use a tool like scp to copy the binary from your computer to the gateway. F.e.:

```bash
scp ~/Downloads/loriot_pi_2_iC880A_USB_1.0.1.tar pi@192.168.2.7:~/`
```

After installing the software the gateway will now show as connected on the LORIOT gateway page and we're ready to work on the device.

![Connected!](assets/lora4.png)

**Tip:** LORIOT has a 'Gateway Tap', which you can access from your gateway page. This allows you to see what messages are being picked up by the gateway, very useful when debugging.

## Building a device

Now off to the interesting work: building a device that can send sensor data over the LoRa network. For example you can create a simple motion sensor using a [PIR sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/189) (under 10 euros at your local hardware store, and 2 euros when ordering from China); but feel free to hook up a different sensor. 

![nrf51-DK, LoRa shield and a PIR sensor](assets/lora6.jpg)

*PIR sensor hooked up to a Nordic Semiconductors nRF51-DK with a LoRa shield*

**Note:** You cannot send data constantly because of duty cycle limitations. This is a requirement of using the open spectrum. If you send too fast sending will fail.

### Registering the device in LORIOT

LoRa is end-to-end encrypted, with two sets of keys. We'll need to program these keys, plus a device ID into the device firmware. We use these keys to sign our messages and be verified by the network server. To generate a new key pair, go to the LORIOT dashboard, click 'Applications', click 'Sample App', click 'Manage Devices', and then click 'Generate New Device'. A device will be added to the list, and click on it to go to the device page.

At the bottom of the page, find 'Seqno checking' and change this setting to 'Relax' (call `setRelax()` from the JS console if the button does not show up).

![Relax, take it easy](assets/lora9.png)

Now that we have the keys we can start writing some software.

### Using the LoRa shield

A disadvantage of the LoRa shield is that it blocks all the pins. You can solder some new headers on the back of the shield to add new peripherals, or use a microcontroller like the nRF51-DK which has the pins available twice, also via through hole connectors.

First [sign up](https://developer.mbed.org/account/signup/?next=%2F) for an account at ARM mbed, which hosts an online compiler which we'll be using. Next find your microcontroller on [the platforms page](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/), and click *'Add to your mbed compiler'*. Second, go to [LoRaWAN-lmic-app](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Semtech/code/LoRaWAN-lmic-app/), and click *'Import this program'*. You'll be redirected to the online compiler where you can give the program a name.

![Importing a program to get started](assets/lora7.png)

**Note:** Make sure that you select the right board in the top right corner of the compiler.

![Selecting the right board is kinda important](assets/lora8.png)

Now we need to set the right frequency depending on the version of the shield you have (and where in the world you are). Open LMiC/lmic.h, and find the following lines:

```
// MBED compiler options
//#define CFG_eu868                                   1
#define CFG_us915                                   1
```

Make sure the right line is uncommented, depending on the shield version that you have.

Now let's program the keys from LORIOT into the device firmware. Open main.cpp, and change the following lines:

```cpp
#define LORAWAN_DEV_ADDR                            ( uint32_t )0x12345678

static uint8_t NwkSKey[] = 
{ 
    0x2B, 0x7E, 0x15, 0x16, 0x28, 0xAE, 0xD2, 0xA6,
    0xAB, 0xF7, 0x15, 0x88, 0x09, 0xCF, 0x4F, 0x3C
};

// application session key
static uint8_t ArtSKey[] = 
{ 
    0x2B, 0x7E, 0x15, 0x16, 0x28, 0xAE, 0xD2, 0xA6,
    0xAB, 0xF7, 0x15, 0x88, 0x09, 0xCF, 0x4F, 0x3C
};
```

* Set `LORAWAN_DEV_ADDR` to the *big endian* DevAddr from LORIOT.
* Set `NwkSKey` and `ArtSKey` to the NWKSKEY and APPSKEY from LORIOT, but turn them into hex numbers. E.g. a LORIOT key of `5ADA30AA` should be `0x5A, 0xDA, 0x30, 0xAA` in your code.

Now we can verify whether our setup works, by hitting the 'Compile' button.

![Compile button](assets/lora10.png)

When compilation succeeds a file will be downloaded. Plug your development board into the computer (over micro-USB) and drag the file onto the board (it mounts as a USB mass storage device, no drivers needed). After the device boots up again, you'll start seeing messages come in!

![We've got data!](assets/lora11.png)

By default the application sends data automatically. If you want to change this, remove these lines from main.cpp:

```cpp
    if( txOn == true )
    {
        //Sends frame every APP_TX_DUTYCYCLE +/- APP_TX_DUTYCYCLE_RND random time (if not duty cycle limited)
        os_setTimedCallback( &sendFrameJob,
                             os_getTime( ) + ms2osticks( APP_TX_DUTYCYCLE + randr( -APP_TX_DUTYCYCLE_RND, APP_TX_DUTYCYCLE_RND ) ),
                             onSendFrame );
        
        ////Sends frame as soon as possible (duty cylce limitations)
        //onSendFrame( NULL );
    }
```

You can now add code that sends a message whenever you want it to. For example when an interrupt fires because someone moves around in front of your PIR sensor. For example:

```cpp
InterruptIn pir(D5);

static void prepareTxFrame( void )
{
    LMIC.frame[0] = pir; // current state of the pir sensor
#if ( LORAWAN_CONFIRMED_MSG_ON == 1 )
    LMIC.frame[1] = LMIC.seqnoDn >> 8;
    LMIC.frame[2] = LMIC.seqnoDn;
    LMIC.frame[3] = LMIC.rssi >> 8;
    LMIC.frame[4] = LMIC.rssi;
    LMIC.frame[5] = LMIC.snr;
#endif    
}

void movement() {
    onSendFrame(NULL);
}

void no_movement() {
    onSendFrame(NULL);
}

int main( void ) {

    pir.rise(movement);
    pir.fall(no_movement);

    // ... lora related things
}
```

Change the content of the `prepareTxFrame` function to change which data you're sending (also update `LORAWAN_APP_DATA_SIZE`). Now we'll get a message whenever the PIR sensor changes state (from motion -> no-motion and the other way around).

### Using the Multitech mDot

First [sign up](https://developer.mbed.org/account/signup/?next=%2F) for an account at ARM mbed, which hosts an online compiler which we'll be using. Next, go to the [Multitech mDot platform page](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/MTS-mDot-F411/), and click *'Add to your mbed compiler'*. Next go to the [mdot_personalized_activation](https://developer.mbed.org/users/janjongboom/code/mdot_personalized_activation/) project page, and click *'Import this program'*. You'll be redirected to the online compiler where you can give the program a name.

![Importing a program to get started](assets/lora12.png)

**Note:** Make sure that you select the right board in the top right corner of the compiler.

![Selecting the right board is kinda important](assets/lora13.png)

Now let's program the keys from LORIOT into the device firmware. Open main.cpp, and copy the big endian DevAddr and the `APPSKEY` and `NWKSKEY`'s from LORIOT into the application:

```cpp
static const char LORIOT_DEV_ADDR[]  = "AABBCCDD"; // Use the big endian version here
static const char LORIOT_NWK_S_KEY[] = "E8A25EBD07F85800E08478A041FACBA7"; // NWKSKEY
static const char LORIOT_APP_S_KEY[] = "BE8EF84E745D0AB14D4507B0BA600555"; // APPSKEY
```

Now we can verify whether our setup works, by hitting the 'Compile' button.

![Compile button](assets/lora10.png)

When compilation succeeds a file will be downloaded. Plug your development board into the computer (over micro-USB) and drag the file onto the board (it mounts as a USB mass storage device, no drivers needed). After the device boots up again, you'll start seeing messages come in!

![We've got data!](assets/lora11.png)

By default the application sends data automatically. If you want to change this, you can remove the `send_data();` call, and call it manually (for example from an interrupt). See the section above about the LoRa shield for more information.

## Building a web application

Now that we have the first three parts of our network up and running, it's time to use the sensor data in a small application. LORIOT offers a number of ways of getting your data out of their service, but the easiest is using a websocket. We can write a quick web application that will turn the page red when movement is detected, and green when everything is OK. We do this by checking the first byte of the LoRa payload (1=movement, 0=no movement).

In LORIOT first go your dashboard, hit 'Applications', hit 'Sample App', and hit 'Output'. Change the output type to 'Websocket'.

![Websocket](assets/lora14.png)

You'll need to replace the URL and the token under 'Current output setup' and put them in the code sample below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>PIR Sensor monitoring!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p id="status">Connecting...</p>
    <script>
    var token = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE';
    var url = 'YOUR_COMPLETE_URL_HERE (incl {token} part)';
    var ws = new WebSocket(url.replace('{token}', token));
    ws.onopen = function() {
        document.querySelector('#status').textContent = 'Connected';
    };
    ws.onclose = function() {
        document.querySelector('#status').textContent = 'Disconnected';
    };
    ws.onmessage = function(e) {
        console.log('onmessage', e);
        var data = JSON.parse(e.data);
        if (data.cmd !== 'rx') return;
        
        switch (Number(data.data.slice(0, 2))) {
            case 0: document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'green'; break;
            case 1: document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'red'; break;
        }
    };
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

And done! We now have a fully functioning LoRa network with a device, a gateway and a web application!

![Full circle](assets/lora15.png)

## Conclusion

LoRa is a great technology with a lot of potential, especially because everyone can set up a network and get started building long range IoT devices with a relatively small investment. I hope that this guide will help you get started and would love to see what you build with LoRa and ARM mbed!
