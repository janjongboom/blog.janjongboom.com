   <p class="article">About 9 months ago an acquisition editor from Manning Publications first
  approached me, asking whether I was interested in writing a book about
  Firefox OS app development. Being a contributor, module peer for keyboard,
  and evangelist for Telenor, that actually made sense. Even when almost
  everyone in my environment that ever wrote a book said: &quot;Yeah, it
  sounds fun, but actually its horrible&quot;. In a way they were right,
  especially the start was though; but during the process I actually had
  more and more fun. The fruit of the labour has now been bundled in an early
  access version of my book &quot;Firefox OS in Action&quot;.

  <br>
  <br>So if you&apos;re interested in getting started on developing apps for
  Firefox OS, get a quick start and buy the early access version. New chapters
  will be added when they are done, and you&apos;ll get the final and fully
  edited copy when it comes out. To put it in the words of a reader:
  <blockquote>
    <div class="quote">Thank for writing a great book. I read the &quot;Welcome to the Future&quot;
      part of your book it is just awesome. Every developer who want to develop
      app for Firefox OS is confused and don&apos;t know how to start. I think
      this book provide a content at one place and clear the all the doubts of
      developer. Information about UI is also great. I am eager to read your
      whole book.</div>
  </blockquote><a href="http://manning.com/jongboom/" rel="external nofollow">BUY BUY BUY!</a> And
  if you don&apos;t care about Firefox OS, just buy it for the beautiful
  images that I created in paint for the early access version. I&apos;ll
  also buy you a beer when you&apos;re in Amsterdam.
