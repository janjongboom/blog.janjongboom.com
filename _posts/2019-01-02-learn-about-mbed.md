First of all, happy new year from the Mbed team!

IoT devices without an internet connection are, well, just devices. But getting connectivity everywhere can be problematic. WiFi and Bluetooth only work at a short range, and 4G requires expensive radios and lots of power. In the past years we have seen the advent of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs), which offer a huge range while consuming very little power. Two such networks are the telco-backed *LTE Cat-M1* and *NB-IoT*, and 2018 saw the [first commercial roll-outs](https://www.gsma.com/iot/deployment-map/) of these networks.

In addition, we've also seen the launch of the first Cat-M1 and NB-IoT Mbed-enabled platforms and modules, including the [u-blox C030-N211](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ublox-C030-N211/), the [Advantech WISE-1570](https://os.mbed.com/modules/advantech-wise-1570/) and the [MultiTech DragonFly Nano](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/MTS-Dragonfly-Nano/). With all that in place, what better way to start 2019 than with a workshop on how you can combine Mbed OS and telco-backed networks to get to market faster?

On Wednesday January 9th, the second day of CES, we're co-hosting a [workshop](https://www.gsma.com/iot/event/how-to-develop-low-power-consumer-solutions-with-cellular-iot/) on building low-power consumer solutions with presentations from a wide variety of telcos, Mbed partners and integrators. Here you'll get an update on network deployments, what boards are coming to Mbed, and get the chance to see new products and development tools. So if you are in Las Vegas next week, make sure to come by and say hi! Admittance is free, and does not require a CES pass.
