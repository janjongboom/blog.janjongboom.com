October was a busy month, with Mbed Connect events in the [US](https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/Its-a-wrap-Mbed-Connect-US-2018-is-done/) and [China](https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/Mbed-Connect-China-2018-Recap/), [TechCon](https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/techcon-wrapup-2018/) and many more community events. But we're not done yet! If you  want to sharpen your skills before the end of the year, talk to us in person, or just share a beer while talking about the latest standards - we've got an event for you. Here are all the places where you can meet people from the Mbed team before 2018 ends.

**7 November - IoT Deep Dive, Pelion Device Management - Austin, US**

We're running IoT Deep Dive - a monthly meetup series - in Austin, Texas (ran by Austin from Austin) and this time we're talking about the firmware update service in Pelion Device Management. Firmware update support is crucial for any long-term IoT deployment, as it's the only way to fix security holes, upgrade functionality, or adapt to changing regulations - without sending a technician to do it. The meetup takes place in Capital Factory downtown Austin. You can sign up on [this meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/IoT-Deep-Dive-Workshop-Meetup/events/255383915/).

**8 November - LoRa in Mbed - Stockholm, Sweden**

Low-Power Wide Area Networks such as LoRaWAN remain a hot topic. With their long range and low power consumption they are a perfect fit for IoT devices. Together with Etteplan, ST and Blink Services, we're organizing a half-day workshop (with breakfast!) to dive into this technology. The day covers how LoRaWAN works, deployment types, and on how to build applications with LoRaWAN and Mbed. If you haven't worked with the [Mbed LoRaWAN stack](https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/Adding-a-LoRaWAN-stack-to-Mbed-OS-58/) that was released in Mbed OS 5.8, this is your chance. [Here's the sign up form](https://www.etteplan.com/about-us/events-webinars/lora-mbed-seminar-and-workshop-stockholmlinkoping-sweden).

**8 November - NFC Office Hours - Online**

Don't want to travel? No problem. We're picking up our office hours series again, this time talking about NFC with Donatien Garnier. There'll be a thirty minute presentation about the new NFC APIs that are added to Mbed OS, followed by an half hour Q&A session. Make sure to sign up for the reminder on our [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp5CgXFFO5I).

**13 November - LoRa Bootcamp - Indianapolis, US**

Want to learn about LoRaWAN but think that Stockholm is a bit too far away? You have another chance at the LoRa Bootcamp in Indianapolis. Co-hosted by Mbed partners Semtech and Murata, there's a full day with in-depth technical presentations, hands-on workshops and free development boards to take home. Austin Blackstone from the Mbed side will be present. [Here is the sign up form](https://info.semtech.com/lora-boot-camp-indianapolis?utm_campaign=LoRa%20Boot%20Camps&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--uA3p-dqXmpjpRU28Hr3ixgcaqaiFTcZ3UQHSWr8Ptm6ZzZItq_6Ix36uh_AFN2ThdJwO4h9VUkCWhjq3sALYdUsZuiA&_hsmi=2&utm_content=2&utm_source=hs_email&hsCtaTracking=f6aacbf7-dfd5-4ec1-990e-afaa70bbfa83%7C58c1f04b-5dbc-457c-9712-6e5baada664a).

**13 November - Tech Symposia - Seoul, Korea**

Tech Symposia is a series of one-day events around Arm technology in Asia. This year brings us to China, Taiwan, India, Korea, and Japan. At the [Korea event](http://myseminar.co.kr/arm/ARM_02.asp), Daniel Lee is representing Mbed to talk about Mbed OS, Pelion, and the technical decisions critical for your IoT deployment. If you can't make it to Korea there's another chance on December 6th at Tech Symposia Tokyo.

**5 December - Mbed Connect - Tokyo, Japan**

After editions in the US and  China, we're closing off the Mbed Connect series in Japan. With a fantastic community, a great workshop track, and ten world-class speakers (all in Japanese!) we're taking over Tokyo on December 5th. If you want to learn more about Mbed, get hands-on with the latest tech from our partners, or sing karaoke with the Mbed Developer Evangelism team, this is your chance. The registration opens soon. Make sure to register straight away, as the event was sold out in two weeks last year.
