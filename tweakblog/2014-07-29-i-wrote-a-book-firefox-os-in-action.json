    "articleHtml": "About 9 months ago an acquisition editor from Manning Publications first approached me, asking whether I was interested in writing a book about Firefox OS app development. Being a contributor, module peer for keyboard, and evangelist for Telenor, that actually made sense. Even when almost everyone in my environment that ever wrote a book said: &quot;Yeah, it sounds fun, but actually its horrible&quot;. In a way they were right, especially the start was though; but during the process I actually had more and more fun. The fruit of the labour has now been bundled in an early access version of my book &quot;Firefox OS in Action&quot;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://manning.com/jongboom/\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img src=\"http://manning.com/jongboom/jongboom_cover150.jpg\" class=\"rml\" alt=\"http://manning.com/jongboom/jongboom_cover150.jpg\" title=\"http://manning.com/jongboom/jongboom_cover150.jpg\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo if you&apos;re interested in getting started on developing apps for Firefox OS, get a quick start and buy the early access version. New chapters will be added when they are done, and you&apos;ll get the final and fully edited copy when it comes out. To put it in the words of a reader:<blockquote><div class=\"quote\">Thank for writing a great book. I read the &quot;Welcome to the Future&quot; part of your book it is just awesome. Every developer who want to develop app for Firefox OS is confused and don&apos;t know how to start. I think this book provide a content at one place and clear the all the doubts of developer. Information about UI is also great. I am eager to read your whole book.</div></blockquote><a href=\"http://manning.com/jongboom/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">BUY BUY BUY!</a> And if you don&apos;t care about Firefox OS, just buy it for the beautiful images that I created in paint for the early access version. I&apos;ll also buy you a beer when you&apos;re in Amsterdam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus it&apos;s the deal of the day so you get 50% off today with code: dotd072914au",
